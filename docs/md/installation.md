In order to produce graphs of populations, one needs the optional [graphiz](https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.
The 3D plots seen in the documentation require properly setting up the [ipyvolume](https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package and configuring it for your local setup.
